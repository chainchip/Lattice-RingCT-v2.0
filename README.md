The Lattice-based Ring Confidential Transactions “**Lattice RingCT v2.0**”, supporting Multiple-Input and Multiple-Output wallets (MIMO) transactions, as a fully functional un-derlying scheme for cryptocurrency applications.It shows how the functionality and security requirements are achieved by employing various tools and techniques from lattice-based cryptography.

## Using Lattice-RingCT
This is the **hcash foundation** commissioned **ChainChip Corporation** based on Joseph's paper[1] to develop the basic code.
